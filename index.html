        <h1>Welcome to the City of Uto!</h1>
        <p>The City of Uto is a sprawling metropolis in the center of Skire that is comprised of three major and
            beautifully designed layers: Fever, Choice, and Key.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div style="border: 3px solid rgb(75, 2, 104); background:rgb(212, 165, 255); 5px; padding: 10px">
        <h2>Fever:</h2>
        <p>
            Fever is the bottommost layer of Uto, and is the most densely populated part of the city! The sprawling
            mega-scape is filled to the brim with activities and hidden gems that range from phenomenal food to vertical
            parks! Inspired by the Cyberpunk genre, Fever is stacked with bright neon lights and is overrun with
            organized groups of individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Be sure to pay the toll, and you’ll be on your way to a fabulous experience wrought with perilous adventure
            and surprises at every twist and turn!

    <div style="border: 3px solid rgb(163, 2, 69); background:rgb(247, 122, 122); margin: 5px; padding: 10px">
        <h2>Key:</h2>
        <p>
            Key is the middle section of the city and has all the most modern amenities available at your fingertips!
            The central disk is built to absorb as much sunlight as possible throughout the day, and the most brilliant
            engineers of our time call this place home to ensure that the solar power is always running, even when the
            sun has long since gone down.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on the lesser-known Solarpunk genre, Key sports a number of breathtaking vistas, manicured parks, and
            sandstone color schemes for all your outdoorsy needs! And the fun doesn’t stop when the sun no longer
            shines. Key is home to a thriving nightlife.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let it be known that the power of yesterday will be the driving force of tomorrow!

        <h2>Choice:</h2>
        <p>
            Choice is the jewel of Uto. Situated at the top of the city, it is a microcosm of illustrious skyscrapers
            and research pavilions! Technology truly is the future, and along with some of the most studious
            researchers, Choice features a number of engineering feats unlike anywhere else in the world. To visit
            Choice is to see all the most prominent technology in the works and to see that the future is actually now.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the top of Choice is the CSO, the Choice Space Observatory, where visitors can see all the beauty that
            space has to offer without worrying about light pollution from the lower levels. The CSO is also the premier
            grant writer in Uto, and it welcomes all forms of research into its collective!
        </p>
        <p>
            So shoot for the moon, but don’t hit it!
